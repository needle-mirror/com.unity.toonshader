  "description": "Unity Toon Shader (Unity-Chan Toon Shader 3) is a toon shader for images and video that is designed to meet the needs of creators working on cel-shaded 3DCG animations.\nUnlike other pre-render toon shaders, all features can be adjusted in real time on Unity, which is the greatest feature of UTS.\n\nUTS has great power and makes a wide variety of character designs possible, from cel-shaded to light novel illustration styles.\n\nUTS has the 3 basic layers of Base Color, 1st Shade Color, and 2nd Shade Color, colors and textures can also accept a wide variety of customization options, such as High Color, Rim Light, MatCap (sphere mapping), and Emissive (light emission).The level of gradation (feather) between colors can also be adjusted in Unity in real-time.\n\nMore precisely, View documentation above.",

    "changelog": "### Updated:\n* Shader version properties in all the render pipeline shaders.\n* Updated installation.md.\n* The inspector window is significantly reorganized.\n* Renamed `Double Shade with Feather` to `Standard`.\n* Renamed `Shading Grade map` to `With Additional Control Maps`.\n* Replaced toggle buttons Off/Active UI to Unity standard toggles.\n* Renamed `Basic Shader Settings` to `Shader Setting`.\n* Replaced some toggle buttons, such as `Emissive UV Coord`, `Specular Mode`, to dropdown menus\n* Specular mode name are not just `Off`/`On` but `Soft`/`Hard`.\n* Made everything in the inspector hidden when disabled to be shown but grayed out.\n* Folder headers use Unity standard style in the inspector window when SRP core newer than 12 is not installed.\n* Folder headers use SRP style in the inspector window when SRP core newer than 12 is installed.\n* Renamed `【DX11 Phong Tessellation Settings】` to `Legacy Pipeline: Phong Tessellation Settings` as it works on Mac too.\n* Renamed term, `Technique`, to `Mode`.\n* Renamed term, `Contribution`, to `Effectiveness`.\n* Renamed foldout name `Light Color Contribution` to `Scene Light Effectiveness Settings`\n* Moved `Gi Intensity` and `Scene Light hi cut filter` to bellow it.\n* Renamed `Scene  Hi-cut filter` to  `Limit Light Intensity` .\n* Renamed term, `High Color`, to `Highlight`.\n* Renamed `Settings for PointLights in ForwardAdd Pass` to `Point Light Settings`.\n* Renamed `Point Light High Cut Filter` to `Filter Point Light Hight Light`.\n* Re-organized Stencil and Clipping settings in the inspector window.\n* Renamed `Stencil Out` to `Draw If Not Equal to`.\n* Renamed `Stencil Mask` to `Replace Stencil Buffer with`.\n* Renamed `Stencil No.` to `Stencil Value`.\n* The above used to be a number field. Now it is editable with IntSlider.\n* Renamed `Inverse MatCap Mask` to `Invert MatCap Mask`.\n* Renamed `Trans Clipping Mode` to `Clip Transparency`.\n* Renamed `Unlit Intensity` to `Metaverse Light Intensity` and `Buiilt-in light settings` are moved into `Metaverse Settings` foldout header in the inspector so that users can understand  setting them is not necessary for usual uses.The setting works only when no directional lights are on the scenes like some VRChat ones.\n* _Unlit_Intensity ranges defined in all the shaders are from 0 to 4. originally they were from 0.001 to 4.\n* Changed built-in light default brightness from 1 to 0.\n* Renamed `Basic Look Dev` to `Shading Step and Feather Settings`.\n* `Advanced settings` in Outline foldout header are always shown.\n* Renamed `Outline Sampler` in Ontline foldout header to `Outline Width Map`.\n* Renamed `Outline-tex` in Ontline foldout header to `Outline Color Map`.\n* Renamed Culling mode itemes from `CullingOff`, `FrontCulling` and `BackCulling` to `Off`, `Frontface` and `Backface`.\n* Renamed `Receive System Shadows` to `Receive Shadows`.\n* Renamed `Shadow Mask on High Color` to `Highlight Blending on Shadows`.\n* Renamed `Highlight Power on Shadows` to `Blending Level`.\n* Renamed `Camera Rolling Stabilizer` to `Stabilize Camera Rolling`.\n* Renamed `ViewShift of Color` to `Color Shifting with View Angle`.\n* Renamed `ViewShift` to `Shifting Target Color`.\n* Renamed `Use Outline Texture` to `Outline Color Map`.\n* Renamed `Use Baked Normal for Outline` to `Baked Normalmap`.\n* Renamed `HighColor Power on Shadow` to `Brightness on Shadows`.\n* Renamed `MatCap Power on Shadow` to `MatCap Blending on Shadows`.\n* Renamed `Color Shift Speed` to `Color Shifting Speed`.\n* Renamed `Blur Level of ShadingGradeMap` to `ShadingGradeMap Blur Level`.\n* Renamed `MatCap Sampler` to `MatCap Map`.\n* Renamed `Blur Level of MatCap Sampler` to `MatCap Blur Level`.\n* Renamed `Rim Light Power` to `Rim Light Level`.\n* Renamed `RimLight Inside Mask` to `Adjust Rim Light Area`.\n* Renamed `Light Direction Mask` under Rim Light Settings to `Light Dreiction Mode`.\n* Renamed `Light Direction Mask Level` to `Light Direction Rim Light Level`.\n* Renamed `Antipodean(Ap)_RimLight` to `Inversed Direciton Rim Light`.\n* Renamed `AP_RimLgiht Power` to `Inversed Rim Light Level`.\n* Renamed `Color Blend Mode` to `Color Bleinding Mode`.\n* Renamed `GI Intesity` to `Light Probe Intensity`\n.\n### Added:\n* Legacy: Compatibility with Single Pass Stereo Rendering.\n* Legacy: Graphics Test 2022.2.\n* Universal RP: Graphics Test 2022.2.\n* HDRP: Graphics Test 2022.2.\n* Project Settings, but quite simple yet.\n* Help buttons to foldout headers in the inspector window, which work newer than Unity 2021.1.\n* Unity-Chan Toon Shader 2 Converter window opens when old shaders are in projects on start up or right after the package is installed.\n* Dependency to srp core take advantege of its help system.\n* Added Tips to Culling Mode popup menu in the inspector window.\n* Added Tips to GUI Toggles in the inspector window.\n* Added Tips to Range Properties in the inspector window.\n### Removed:\n* Removed   `● Additional Settings` in the Inspector window.\n* Removed Simple UI.\n* Removed Japanese and English manual link buttons.\n* Removed Game Recommendation window and changed the default values of shader variables.\n* Removed 【】in the Inspector window.\n* Removed  ● in the Inspector window.\n* Removed unnecessary labels in the inspector such as `System Shadows:`\n* `RTHS(Realtime Hard Shadow` is deprecated now as it will not be Unity official package.\n* RTHS is not shown unless `Show deprecated features in the inspector` is checked in the `Project Settings Window`.\n### Fixed:\n* Undo/Redo was not working on some items in the inspector window.\n* Fixed Indent in NoramMap Settings in the inspector window.\n* `Point Light High Cut Filter` Side Effects. It just shows or hides the point lights' highlight.\n* Unify the notation in the converter with Unity-Chan Toon Shader 2.\n* Fixed some popups in the inspector window not to use connected names without spaces. Each name is separated by a space.\n* `Rimlight Mask` on URP and HDRP version were not working well.\n* Single pass stereo rendering was not working with legacy(built-in) tessellation shaders.\n* URP shader errors when used with Unity 2022.2."
