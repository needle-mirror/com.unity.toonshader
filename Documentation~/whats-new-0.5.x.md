## HDRP AOV

Added compatibility with HDRP AOV, which makes it possible to record Beauty, Albedo, Normal and other AOV sequential images using Recorder later than 3.0.

* Known Issue:
UTS outline is also output when recording with AOV image sequences, in such cases, please disable OUTLINE in Meterial Inspectors.
