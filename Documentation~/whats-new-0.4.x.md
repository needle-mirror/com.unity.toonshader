## HDRP Box Light.

In animation and game production, there are times when you want to use lighting that differs from the scene in order to show the face of a character more clearly or to add shadows that look ideal. However, in HDRP, the number of directional lights that can cast shadows is limited to one. The Box Light feature is a workaround for this, and UTS now supports it. Currently, raytraced shadows cannot be used with this feature.
